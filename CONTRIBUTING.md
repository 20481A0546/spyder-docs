# Contributing to the Spyder Documentation

First off, thanks for your interest in helping out with the documentation
for Spyder, the Scientific Python Development Environment!

**Important Note:** This is the repository for Spyder's documentation sources,
not the IDE itself. For more information about Spyder, please see the
[website](https://spyder-ide.github.io/), and for the core Spyder codebase,
visit the [main repo](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder) . Thanks!

For more guidance on the basics of using ``git`` and Github to contribute
to Spyder and its documentation, please see the contributing guidelines in
the main Spyder repository mentioned above, and check out the
[Spyder Development Documentation](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Contributing-to-Spyder)
for detailed instructions.

To view the rendered and deployed documentation itself, please visit
our Github pages documentation site (coming soon!).



## Reporting Issues

If you find a typo in the text, a passage that could be clarified,
or would like a section or document added or expanded upon, please submit
an issue report documenting the bug, enhancement or new content
following the guidance in our issue template.

If referring to a particular word, line or section, please be sure to provide
a snippet of context and/or the file and line number to allow us to find
and fix it, and if pointing out a problem, please be as specific as you can
in suggesting a revised wording that would solve it. Issue reports that
don't contain enough information to allow us to do something about them
will be closed.



## Submitting Pull Requests

We welcome contributions from the community, and will do our best to
review all of them in a timely fashion. To do so, please submit a
pull request (PR) to this repo against the appropriate branch with your
changes, and create a corresponding issue as well if your change is
substantive, so that we can keep track of everything and give you
credit for closing it.
