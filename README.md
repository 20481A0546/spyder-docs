## Spyder IDE Documentation

This repository contains the source for the
[documentation](https://spyder-ide.github.io/spyder-docs/)
for Spyder, the Scientific Python Development Environment.

For more information about Spyder itself,
please see the [website](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) and the
[main repo](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder)

We welcome your contributions of corrections, additions and enhancements to
these docs, as they are very much a work in progress and we appreciate getting
our broad community involved wherever possible. To do so, simply submit a
PR with your changes and we'll be happy to review it; make sure to read our
[Contributing Guide](
https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in mind
to ensure the process of getting your revisions integrated goes smoothly.

The docs are built with
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html)
and deployed with [Doctr](https://drdoctr.github.io/doctr/)
to our Github Pages docs site (coming soon). The ``master`` branch contains
the docs for the forthcoming release of Spyder 4, currently planned for
Q1 2019 if funding is secured, while the ``3.x`` branch has the docs for
the current version, Spyder 3.

Thanks for your interest in Spyder and its documentation, and we appreciate
your support of the project!
