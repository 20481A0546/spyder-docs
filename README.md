## Spyder IDE Documentation

This repository contains the source for the documentation
for Spyder, the Scientific Python Development Environment.

We welcome your contributions of corrections, additions and enhancements to
these docs, as they are very much a work in progress and we appreciate getting

and deployed with [Doctr](https://drdoctr.github.io/doctr/)

The ``master`` branch contains the docs for the forthcoming release of
Spyder 4, currently planned for Q1 2019 if funding is secured,
while the ``3.x`` branch has the docs for the current version, Spyder 3.
