## Spyder IDE Documentation

This repo contains the up to date sources for the Spyder scientific development
environment's documentation. For more information about Spyder itself,
please see the [website](https://spyder-ide.github.io/) and the
[main repo](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder)

We welcome your contributions of corrections, additions and enhancements to
these docs, as they are very much a work in progress and we appreciate getting
our broad community involved wherever possible. To do so, simply submit a
PR with your changes and we'll be happy to review it; make sure you keep our
contributing guidelines in mind to ensure the process of getting your
revisions integrated is smooth and successful (see CONTRIBUTING.md for more).

The docs are built with
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html)
and deployed with [Doctr](https://drdoctr.github.io/doctr/)
to our Github Pages docs site (coming soon). The ``master`` branch contains
the docs for the forthcoming release of Spyder 4, currently planned for
Q1 2019 if funding is secured, while the ``3.x`` branch has the docs for
the current version, Spyder 3.

Thanks for your interest in Spyder and its documentation, and we appreciate
your support of the project!
