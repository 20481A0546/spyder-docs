Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts.
It features a unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization capabilities of a scientific package.



============
Where to go?

Spyder's documentation is divided into five main sections. In the first section, the overview you will find a general description of Spyder's interface and the basic function of some of its panes.

Spyder's code and documentation are written in English and will continue this way for its (hopefully long) lifetime. However, in order to reach more users in need of a powerful python development environment there is opportunity to translate the documentation and the interface into different languages.

For this purpose we use `Crowdin`_, which provides a simple web based interface for translators, proof readers and managers where everyone can help us translate Spyder into any language.
