Want to help translate spyder?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spyder's code and documentation are written in English and will continue this way for its (hopefully long) lifetime.
However, in order to reach more users in need of a powerful python development environment there is opportunity to translate the documentation and the interface into different languages.

For this purpose we use `Crowdin`_, which provides a simple web based interface for translators, proof readers and managers where everyone can help us translate Spyder into any language.
